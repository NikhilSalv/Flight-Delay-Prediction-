# Flight-Delay-Prediction-
In this notebook, I have built a model to predict the delay at take off of a flight by using variables.
This dataset has 13 variables.The description of the data is as below.

w : This column is a number of a month in an year.
DayofMonth: This column has the values of number of a day in a month.

DepTime: The actual departure time (local, hhmm)
CRSDepTime: scheduled departure time. (CRS is Computarized Reserved System)
ArrTimeCRSArrTime: Arrival time as per  Computerized Reservations Sysytems
ActualElapsedTime: The physical time that has elapsed since the CRS time
CRSElapsedTime: CRS Elapsed Time of Flight (estimated elapse time), in minutes
ArrDelay: Difference in minutes between scheduled and actual arrival time.
Early arrivals show negative numbers, in minutes
Distance: Distance between airports (miles)
